    <h2>The Origins of Immigration</h2>
    <p>Many people come from many places. The five largest ethic groups in the United States all come from different parts of the world. In this short paragraph I will explain why the five largest groups ARE the five largest groups. The largest ethnic group in America are the Germans, at 17.1% of the population. European mass immigration to the United States began in earnest only after the end of the Napoleonic wars in 1815, at a time when transatlantic commercial shipping resumed. Soon a first major wave of 20,000 emigrants from southwestern Germany took place, occasioned by major crop failures in the years 1816-17. Similarly with the Irish, holding 11.6% of the population, many traveled to the U.S. after the potato famine. Unfortunately, the Africans never immigrated here, they were taken by force. The main reason so many African American's are here is because of the slave economy. Mexicans, having 10.9% of the population, have migrated hear for a plethora of reasons. High availability of work in America, high crime rates in Mexico, and the natural hardships of living in Mexico due to climate are all push factors that cause many people in Mexico to migrate into the U.S., legally or not. Regardless of reason, many different people make up the population of America; they all bring their distinct culture and strengthen the future of our country.</p>
